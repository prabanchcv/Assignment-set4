To solve the problem of finding critical connections in a network, you can use Tarjan's algorithm, which is an efficient algorithm for finding bridges in a graph.

Initialize the necessary data structures:

1.Create an adjacency list to represent the connections between nodes.
2.Create an array to store the discovery time of each node.
3.Create an array to store the low value of each node.
4.Create a boolean array to mark nodes as visited.
5.Create a result array to store the critical connections.
6.Perform a depth-first search traversal starting from any node in the network:

     Mark the current node as visited.
     Assign a discovery time to the current node and initialize its low value with the discovery time.
     Traverse all the neighbors of the current node
     If the neighbor is not visited, recursively call the DFS function on it.
     Update the low value of the current node based on the low value of its neighbor.
     If the low value of the neighbor is greater than the discovery time of the current node, it means the connection between the current node and the neighbor is a critical connection. Add it to the result array.
     Return the result array containing all the critical connections in the network.

The intuition behind Tarjan's algorithm is that the low value of a node represents the earliest visited node (discovery time) that can be reached from that node or any of its descendants. If the low value of a neighbor node is greater than the discovery time of the current node, it implies that there is no other way to reach that neighbor node except through the current node, making the connection between them a critical connection.

By applying Tarjan's algorithm, you can efficiently find all the critical connections in the network.
